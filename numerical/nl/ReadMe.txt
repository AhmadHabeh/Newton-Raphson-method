This code is an implementation of the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of a given function. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

The code includes the necessary header files for input/output and mathematical functions.

There are two functions defined: funx and funx1. The funx function calculates the value of the given function, which is x^3 + 4x - 5, and returns the result. The funx1 function calculates the derivative of the function, which is 3x^2 + 4, and returns the result.

The main function is where the main logic of the program resides.

It starts by declaring and initializing some variables: iteration represents the maximum number of iterations allowed, accurcey represents the number of decimal places to round the root, 
x0 represents the initial guess for the root, x1 represents the updated value of the root, TV represents the tolerance value, fx and fx1 represent the function value and its derivative at each iteration,
flag is a boolean variable used to control the loop, and i and j are counters.

The user is prompted to enter the initial guess for the root (x0).

The main loop starts, which continues until the root is found or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

Inside the loop, the function value (fx) and its derivative value (fx1) are calculated using the funx and funx1 functions, respectively. These values are then printed to the console.

The updated value of the root (x1) is calculated using the Newton-Raphson formula: x1 = x0 - fx / fx1. The value of x1 is then rounded to the specified number of decimal places.

Next, the code checks if the absolute value of the function value (fx) is less than the tolerance value (TV) or if fx is equal to zero. If either condition is true, it means that the root has been found, and the loop is terminated. The root value (x1) is printed to the console.

If the root is not found, the value of x0 is updated to x1, and the loop continues to the next iteration.

The loop also checks if the maximum number of iterations (iteration) has been reached. If so, it means that the root could not be found within the specified number of iterations, and the loop is terminated. An appropriate message is printed to the console.

Finally, the program ends.

Please note that the code assumes that the provided function has a root and does not handle cases where the derivative is zero or the function does not converge to a root.
